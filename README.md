## Essence

The modular & component-based UI library that you likely have been waiting for. No more worrying about weird syntaxis and not accessible Lua objects, you can control everything here.

Note that this library isn't for games, it is oriented to create plugin interfaces.

### **Features**

* Component based, modular architecture.
* State managment, re-render based on the state.
* Interact with components externally without state managment.
