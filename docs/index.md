Welcome to the Essence documentation! Thanks for choosing my framework as the pillar for your plugin.

#### Why Essence over others?

* Modular architecture, no more spaghetti code.
* Lightweight, no more than 400 lines of code.
* You can interact with Components outside the `Render` function, this is extremely useful when creating plugins.
