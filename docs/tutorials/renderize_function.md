Well, as you can see in the code, there's a `renderize` function which can be called with no arguments but still does something, it basically renders the build that you generated with the Essence inspector, note that isn't for plugins as it renders a game interface data build.

## Generating the **Build**

You can generate a build for your game interface data with the "Build" tab inside Essence inspector, after you clicked it, it will build an optimized data that you can use for production games and can render with the `Essence.renderize` function.
